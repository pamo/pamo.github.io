One might think my culinary adventures in Bali were predominately chicken based with a quick glance at the recipes in my post about [cooking in Bali](/bali-cooking/). However, outside of the wedding and cooking class, my meals were primarily vegetarian (and at some points vegan). The ubiquity of raw, vegan, or vegetarian restaurant menu's in Bali took me by surprise.

The ubiquity is normal to me in San Francisco given my circle of friends forms a Venn diagram in a variety of dietary choices. My excuse to try quirky new places or dishes in San Francisco will form once I have another interested friend to bring along. After spending several _vegan-ish_ days in Bali, I wish I'd been able to bring all my vegan and vegetarian friends along.

## Kismet Caf√©

"Awesome ambiance, with hippie-rocker types eating insanely delicious vegetarian sandwiches & sipping kombucha. Has one of the fastest wifi connections in town."
A major stand out in Ubud to me was Kismet. My first visit had me craving their Asian bowl again the next day. By my third visit, they recognized me as a regular, and for me, it was a great departing meal before flying back home.

## Moksa

Road leading up to the restaurant is tiny. You're running the risk of falling into a rice field if you bring or take a car. Better off with motorbike or on foot. Although roads leading to the restaurant don't really have a shoulder to walk on. View of the permaculture garden before sunset made me think of mine and the possibilities for adding more consumable crops. Listened to freak economic podcast about phenomenons about waiting in line for food. Lucky for me solo dining meant no wait. Seated in what felt like a big gazebo. Open air candle lit.

$15!

amuse-bouche was a cucumber with some sort of hummus? Wasn't paying attention.

Spiced cashews in the salad were nice and I liked them. Tender greens. Parmesan flakes were cool.
Creamy sauce with the braised cabbages tamed the spice. Kept sopping it up.

Jerky mignon was squishy thick and meaty. More like slider patties. Needs some water to wash it down.  Softer than what I expected. Sear marks are always a nice satisfying touch.

The cabbages had a caramelizada feel. Saw some onions.

Saved the purple sweet potatoes for last. Had a beetroot-y taste. Crunchy skin in addition to sesame seed crust. Saltier than the other items. Chili salt. Cajun almost.

### Gelato Secrets

Vibrant and funky sorbet flavors made me do a double take. Got the black charcoal and passionfruit cinnamon as my last snack in Ubud.
