With a quick glance at the recipes in my post about [cooking in Bali](/bali-cooking/), one might think my culinary adventures in Bali were predominately chicken-based. However, outside of the wedding and cooking class, my meals were primarily vegetarian (and at sometimes vegan). The ubiquity of raw, vegan, or vegetarian restaurant menus in Bali took me by surprise.

The ubiquity is normal to me in San Francisco given my circle of friends forms a Venn diagram in the variety of dietary choices. My excuse to try quirky new places or dishes in San Francisco form once I have another interested friend to bring along. For example, I keep a mental note of which friends to call when my favorite Feastly pop-up chefs, [Om Sabor](https://eatfeastly.com/omsabor/), host a Mexican-inspired vegan dinner.

I really missed these friends with every day spent being solo and _veganish_ in Bali and I am excited to be able to act as a guide if I ever make it back with a larger squad.

## Kismet Cafe

Kismet Cafe was a major stand-out in Ubud. My first visit had me craving their Asian bowl again the next day. By my third visit, they recognized me as a regular, and, for me, it was a great departing meal before flying back home. The restaurant has two floors with open-air seating and it was never too busy. I spent most of my visits devouring their bowls, drinking kombucha or kefir, and sometimes reading or editing photos.

What I really liked about their bowls was the ability to get them with a variety of skewers. I had the option to get 3 or 5 and I always got 5. The first visit was a mix of tofu, seitan, grilled vegetables, mushrooms, and tempeh. After this first visit I discovered which of those options were my favorites. My second and third visit leaned towards choosing 2 tempeh skewers, 1 seitan, and 2 mushroom.

The volume in each of the bowls was very satiating. My belly was happy after each visit. These were 'bowls' in the sense that you could choose between red steamed rice or rice noodles. I chose noodles in my first visit (they were crunchy and thin like [Maggi noodles](http://www.tasty-indian-recipes.com/snacks-recipes/maggi-vegetable-atta-noodles-recipe/)), decided I didn't like them, and got red rice the second time. I enjoyed the red rice's nutty taste, but for my third visit, I opted to make the bowl a salad with extra avocado.

I tried the 'classic' bowl during my first visit, but the Asian bowl was definitely the best in my opinion. It has kimchi!

## Moksa

Road leading up to the restaurant is tiny. You're running the risk of falling into a rice field if you bring or take a car. Better off with motorbike or on foot. Although roads leading to the restaurant don't really have a shoulder to walk on. View of the permaculture garden before sunset made me think of mine and the possibilities for adding more consumable crops. Listened to freak economic podcast about phenomenons about waiting in line for food. Lucky for me solo dining meant no wait. Seated in what felt like a big gazebo. Open air candle lit.

$15!

amuse-bouche was a cucumber with some sort of hummus? Wasn't paying attention.

Spiced cashews in the salad were nice and I liked them. Tender greens. Parmesan flakes were cool.
Creamy sauce with the braised cabbages tamed the spice. Kept sopping it up.

Jerky mignon was squishy thick and meaty. More like slider patties. Needs some water to wash it down.  Softer than what I expected. Sear marks are always a nice satisfying touch.

The cabbages had a caramelizada feel. Saw some onions.

Saved the purple sweet potatoes for last. Had a beetroot-y taste. Crunchy skin in addition to sesame seed crust. Saltier than the other items. Chili salt. Cajun almost.

### Gelato Secrets

Vibrant and funky sorbet flavors made me do a double take. Got the black charcoal and passionfruit cinnamon as my last snack in Ubud.
