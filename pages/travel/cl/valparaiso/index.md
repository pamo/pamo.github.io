## Food
* [La Cocó Sangucheria Artesanal](https://www.swarmapp.com/pmocampo/checkin/56450039498eb27c41e6d1a8): Ate here twice, because it was open late. Very cute shop with beer and wine.
* [El Pimentón](https://www.swarmapp.com/pmocampo/checkin/564542b5498ed7733ece6dcf): Chilean comfort food. Super cheap price for a whole pork leg. The place seemed dive-y but it had a very local vibe.
* [Artesanales Alfajores](http://4sq.com/2aqhEZH): Ring [Don Sergio's](/don-sergio/) door and ask for a warm empanada and alfajor. :heart:
* [Fauna](https://www.swarmapp.com/pmocampo/checkin/56471814498e81780a11d8c7): Have the fresh catch of the day with a glass of wine under the stars.
* [Mercado El Cardonal](https://www.swarmapp.com/pmocampo/checkin/5647a817498ee02cffc073c3): Indoor market with lots of mom-and-pop restaurants. The quality of the food is a hit or miss and most of the restaurants are cash only.

## Coffee
* [PuroCafé](https://www.swarmapp.com/pmocampo/checkin/56475250498e6815abb7af26): Chemex and fresh-roasted beans smell divine. The architecture of the building is also cool, very Gothic.
* [Café con Cuento](https://www.swarmapp.com/pmocampo/checkin/5647b9c4498e9edb42bd71ba): Not specialty coffee but the mural of the fairy-tale prince that adorns the outside is very picturesque.
